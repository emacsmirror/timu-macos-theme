2 Configuration
***************

Dark and light fravour
----------------------

By default the theme is ‘dark’.  To setup the ‘light’ flavour add the following
to your ‘~/.emacs.d/init.el’ or ‘~/.emacs’:

    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-flavour "light")

Scaling
-------

You can now scale some faces (in ‘org-mode’ for now):

   • ‘org-document-info’
   • ‘org-document-title’
   • ‘org-level-1’
   • ‘org-level-2’
   • ‘org-level-3’

More to follow in the future.

By default the scaling is turned off.  To setup the scaling add the following
to your ‘~/.emacs.d/init.el’ or ‘~/.emacs’:

Default scaling

   This will turn on default values of scaling in the theme.

    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-scale-org-document-title t)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-scale-org-document-info t)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-scale-org-level-1 t)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-scale-org-level-2 t)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-scale-org-level-3 t)

Custom scaling

   You can choose your own scaling values as well.  The following is a
   somewhat exaggerated example.

    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-scale-org-document-title 1.8)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-scale-org-document-info 1.4)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-scale-org-level-1 1.8)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-scale-org-level-2 1.4)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-scale-org-level-3 1.2)

"Intense" colors for org-mode
-----------------------------

To emphasize some elements in org-mode.  You can set a variable to make some
faces more "intense".

By default the intense colors are turned off.  To turn this on add the
following to your ‘~/.emacs.d/init.el’ or ‘~/.emacs’:

    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-org-intense-colors t)

Color contrast for the theme
----------------------------

You can set the color contras for the dark flavour of the theme.

By default the color contrast is set to ‘normal’.  To set the desired contrast
add one of the following to your ‘~/.emacs.d/init.el’ or ‘~/.emacs’:

    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-color-contrast 'normal)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-color-contrast 'muted)
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-color-contrast 'contrasted)

Border for the mode-line
------------------------

You can set a variable to set the border type for the mode-line.  Either no
border, just on the top or all around.

By default the border is turned off.  For your preferred type add one of the
following to your ‘~/.emacs.d/init.el’ or ‘~/.emacs’:

    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-mode-line-border-type "none")
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-mode-line-border-type "border")
    (customize-set-variable 'timu-macos-mode-line-border-type "overline")
